*An intuitive machine learning library for beginners, in python.*  
This library targets individuals who want to learn machine learning code from scratch keeping _code-readability_ and _simplicity_ over efficiency.

## Goals
 - To document every bit of code and make it easy to understand.
 - To bridge the gap between the theoretical and coding aspects of machine learning algorithms.
 - To write [intuitive blogs as python notebooks](https://markroxor.github.io/fromscratchtoml/showroom/) so as to juxtapose theory and code. Explaining the fundamentals of the algorithm from the very basics.  
 - To minimise the use of external dependencies except the fundamental ones like `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
 - To make sure that the developed algorithms are coherent with already existing machine learning frameworks.
 - And above all - to be a one stop repository for understanding almost all the basic machine learning algorithms.

## Installation
#### Python pypi <a name="pypi"></a>
You can install from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/fromscratchtoml/).

    pip install fromscratchtoml

This is the most stable build.


#### Compiling manually <a name="manual"></a>
If you are interested in installing the most bleeding edge but not too stable version. You can install
from source -  


    git clone https://github.com/markroxor/fromscratchtoml.git
    pip install -r requirements.txt  
    python setup.py install

## Tutorials and support
* Well documented API usage is available at [pydoc](https://www.pydoc.io/pypi/fromscratchtoml-0.0.1/)
* For discussion and support visit - [the gitter channel](https://gitter.im/markroxor/from-scratch-to-ml)
* Development discussions and bugs reports can be tracked on [issue tracker](https://github.com/markroxor/fromscratchtoml/issues).

## Future endeavours
* This library will form a back-bone for teaching and guiding budding machine learning developers via vBlogs.

## Inspiration
> Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
While I don't claim to be a great programmer, I try to imitate one. An important trait of the great ones is constructive laziness. They know that you get an A not for effort but for results, and that it's almost always easier to start from a good partial solution than from nothing at all.
Linus Torvalds, for example, didn't actually try to write Linux from scratch. Instead, he started by reusing code and ideas from Minix, a tiny Unix-like operating system for PC clones. Eventually all the Minix code went away or was completely rewritten—but while it was there, it provided scaffolding for the infant that would eventually become Linux.

> The Game of Life (or simply Life) is not a game in the conventional sense. There
are no players, and no winning or losing. Once the "pieces" are placed in the
starting position, the rules determine everything that happens later.
Nevertheless, Life is full of surprises! In most cases, it is impossible to look
at a starting position (or pattern) and see what will happen in the future. The
only way to find out is to follow the rules of the game.
