Omega project is a step towards removing the black box in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Most of the big machine learning projects out there are quite difficult for a beginner to understand and this is by design. These projects are designed to be optimum and stable, since they are to be used for research and production purposes. This significantly reduces the readability of code for someone who is taking his first steps in the field of ML & AI. 

In omega project we focus on code readbility rather than optimization. Our prime objective is to make code understandable for anyone who has basic coding experience. We are implementing most of the algorithms used in ML & AI using simple python. We use numpy equivalent functions in pytorch just for matrix operations and if possible use GPU backend. All the implementations are written in simplest manner and well documented for anyone to understand.
